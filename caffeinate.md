## run caffeinate for whole macbook
since server for lmstudio cant be run externally so we need to active the whole mac to prevent that server from sleeping
caffeinate -i
if running this in vscode do not work use terminal externally and run it


##additional info

	•	caffeinate -i: This command prevents your MacBook from going to sleep due to user inactivity, ensuring that both your Flask application (on port 5002) and the other server (on port 1234) continue to run even if you close the lid.

    •	Keep the caffeinate Terminal Session Open: The caffeinate command must remain running in the Terminal. As long as it is active, your MacBook won’t sleep, and both servers will stay up.
	•	Stopping caffeinate: To allow your MacBook to sleep again, you can stop the caffeinate command by pressing Ctrl + C in the Terminal or simply closing the Terminal window.
